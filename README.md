# Project Overview

This project is based on the analysis of Anemia data and prediction of Anemia level.

# Resources

# Tools

1. Python
2. Pandas and Numpy
3. Sci-kit learn
4. Excel

# Data Prepration

First I remove the the null data from the dataset.

Then I analyse the relationship of Anemia levels with various factors

And at last I predict the Anemia level using [Support vector machine](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html)
